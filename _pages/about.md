Nice to meet you here!    

I am Chi Zhang, currently a first-year Ph.D. Student in the Department of Health Technology and Informatics at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) and a member of [Jockey Club STEM Laboratory of Genomics and AI in Healthcare](https://genomicmedicine.github.io/site/#/), where I am honored to work with [Prof. Weixiong Zhang](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/hti/people/academic-staff/prof-zhang-weixiong/).

I received my M.Eng. degree (2023) from the School of Information and Communication Engineering at the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC), where I was a member of [MediaLab](https://medialab.uestc.edu.cn/) and had the privilege of working with [Prof. Shuai Wang](https://faculty.uestc.edu.cn/wangshuai/zh_CN/index.htm) and [Prof. Changhui Rao](https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~chrao). Prior to attending UESTC, I earned a B.Eng. degree (2020) in Communication Engineering from the North China Institute of Aerospace Engineering (NCIAE). I was also a part-time research assistant at the School of Science, Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen (HITSZ), where I was grateful to collaborate with [Prof. Yang Zhang](https://faculty.hitsz.edu.cn/zhangyang) from 2021 to 2023.
